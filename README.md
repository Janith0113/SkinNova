# Explainable Multi-Modal AI for Dermatological Disease Identification

## AI-Driven Framework for Diagnosing Psoriasis, Tinea, Leprosy & Skin Cancer with Explainable Multimodal Analysis

This project develops an integrated AI system combining computer vision, sensor analytics, and multimodal data fusion to diagnose and manage four major dermatological conditions. By leveraging image analysis, environmental data, clinical metadata, and laboratory reports with explainable AI techniques, the system provides clinicians with interpretable diagnostics and personalized treatment guidance.
​

The unified framework addresses limitations of single-modality systems through four specialized components, each incorporating novel multimodal fusion and explainability tailored to clinical workflows.

Flare-up prediction & natural risk level recommendations

### 🎯 Objectives
Real-time psoriasis detection with environmental context

Personalized treatment based on phototype & conditions

Predictive analytics for flare-up prevention

​


## 2️⃣ Tinea Detection with Ayurvedic Integration
### Owner: Gunawardhana.D.N.M.P (IT22629876)

### 🔍 Key Components
Tinea classification (dry/wet types)

Smartwatch dosha detection (HR, HRV)

Personalized Ayurvedic diet & herbal recommendations

### 🎯 Objectives
Automated tinea recognition from images

Dosha-based holistic treatment planning

Privacy-aware federated learning architecture

​

## 3️⃣ Leprosy Diagnosis via Multimodal Fusion
### Owner: Bambarandage.T.B.M.S (IT22006370)

### 🔍 Key Components
AI image classification for Leprosy

Personalized Lifestyle & Self-Care Guidance Engine

Probability-based risk scores

### 🎯 Objectives
To develop an accurate and robust image-based model for early leprosy risk identification.

To support early screening and triage, not clinical diagnosis of leprosy.

To enable seamless integration with doctor referral and patient guidance modules.

​

## 4️⃣ Skin Cancer Detection & Risk Stratification

### Owner: Kulasekara.K.M.D (IT22313270)

### 🔍 Key Components
Dermoscopic image analysis using CNN / Vision Transformer (ViT) models

Multimodal fusion with patient metadata

Dual explainability (Grad-CAM + SHAP)

### 🎯 Objectives
Detect Melanoma  risk scores

Generate risk scores to support early screening and clinical decision-making

Provide clinically interpretable and explainable AI outputs for dermatologist trust


## Technologies Used

🤖 Multimodal AI (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
🖼️ Computer Vision (CNN, Vision Transformers)
📊 Explainable AI 
📱 Mobile Sensors (temp, humidity)
⚕️ Clinical Decision Support Systems


## 📈 Why This Project Matters

### Current dermatological AI systems suffer from:

Single-modality limitations (image-only)

Black-box predictions lacking clinical trust

No integration of environmental/clinical context

Underrepresentation of tropical diseases (tinea, leprosy)

This system provides: Clinical-grade explainability + multimodal fusion + region-specific disease focus
